# MA Dissertation - 'UNSC Membership and its Economic Benefits'

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) ‘impacts the lives of millions of people around the
world’ (Gifkins, 2021). Within this expansive and crucial global council sits the permanent five
(P5), including the United Kingdom, United States, France, Russia, and China, who all carry
exclusive veto powers - with ten non-permanent members interchanged every two years per
General Assembly elections (United Nations, 2023). Institutionally, the core responsibility of the
UNSC is to ‘maintain international peace and security’ (United Nations, 2023). Scholars have
argued that this core principle has expanded; one scholar defined their new framework as
‘conferring legitimacy on certain forms of international intervention but also now providing a
mechanism for burden-sharing of expenses and risk’ (Malone, 2000). The question posed here is
how overarching has the UNSC become?

Taking into consideration the aformentioned, this paper aims to look at the relationship UNSC
membership has with international trade; the trade benefits countries receive through the medium
of membership.
